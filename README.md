# CYF Hotel Backend
This backend server is built to support the CYF Hotel project, providing essential APIs and services for managing hotel bookings and related data.

## Features
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful APIs for managing hotel bookings, rooms, guests, and more.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve hotel data efficiently.

- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling to ensure smooth operation and graceful degradation in case of failures.
- **Logging**: Logs relevant events and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Documentation**: Provides comprehensive documentation for API endpoints and usage.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation and specification.
